ReactiveMediaPlayer
===================

A ReactiveCocoa-powered Media Player for iOS


Intro

ReactiveMediaPlayer offers a lightweight, powerful, and aesthetically-pleasing UIView subclass to play videos and music in your app. It includes beautifully designed default controls inspired by the look and feel of Apple's own music apps. It's core functionality is a refined and useful wrapper for AVFoundation which includes nice subclasses of AVPlayer and AVPlayerLayer. It has none of the limitations of MPMusicPlayerController...you can use it full screen, or you can position it as an adorable little square like you would any other UIView.

NOTE: This library is built using ReactiveCocoa and ReactiveCocoaLayout. Many of it's APIs are offered as ReactiveCocoa signals, so if you're not a ReactiveCocoa user, you might want to look elsewhere for a media player project.
